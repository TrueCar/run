run

s/run/the-correct-program/ $@

run dispatches command line arguments to a program, based your configuration in your .runrc file(s).
I find this useful for running a number of different types of scripts with the same command in my IDE/Text editor.

For example, I program in Ruby and Node.js. I want to use the same command to run my scripts, despite having to switch between two languages.
All I need to do now is run:

    run my_spec.rb

In my .runrc file, I have a mapping between files with the extension .rb and ruby.

Here is my ~/.runrc file.

    #!/bin/bash
    file=$1
    if [[ $file =~  .rb$ ]]; then exec ruby $@; fi
    if [[ $file =~  .js$ ]]; then exec node $@; fi

run also allows you to configure a separate .runrc file in a directory-specific basis.
For example, I'm working on my fork (http://github.com/btakita/jasmine-node) of the jasmine-node project (http://github.com/mhevery/jasmine-node ).
In order to run specs, I need it to go through the specs.sh script within that project.

To accomplish that, I create a .runrc file at the root of the project:

    #!/bin/bash
    file=$1
    if [[ $file =~ .+Spec.js$ ]]; then exec ./specs.sh $@; fi

When I run a file ending with 'Spec.js', it will exec that through specs.sh.
